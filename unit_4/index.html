		<p>Our goal is simple: To provide readers a practical approach to life's complexities. Many working professionals devote time and money to increasing their professional skills but lack a basic understanding of how the world outside of their jobs truly works. Whether it is understanding the process for applying for a mortgage on your first home, or the pros and cons of purchasing whole-life versus term-llife insurance, the MORS team understands that information is useless without clear explanation and context. Our webiste is dedicated to the proposition that the better informed our readers are, the better their outcomes. We make complex subjects relevant and empower our readers to apply this knowledge to their daily lives.</p>
			<ul> Topics covered by the MORS team span a wide variety of subject areas, including, but not limited to: 
					<li>Law</li>
					<li>Real Estate</li>
					<li>Business</li>
					<li>Financial Planning</li>
					<li>Sports and Entertainment</li>
